# Zephyr Temperature Sensor

Make sure you have zephyr installed! If you don't, got through the [getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) and come back after you have completed that.

# Installation

1. clone the github to wherever you want it to be (even outside the zephyr workspace as this is a [freestanding applicaiton](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#zephyr-freestanding-app))

2. make sure that you have your virtual environment activated from the zephyrproject workspace 
3. Write your code for the device driver and the temperature sensor. 
4. Build and flash and it should work (fingers crossed)

(none of this has been tested so if it doesn't work tell me and I will try to fix it)
